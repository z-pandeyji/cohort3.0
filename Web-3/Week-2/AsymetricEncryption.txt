Asymetric Encryption is known as public key cryptography. 

In this Ecryption Method we use key pair. 

Public Key to encrypt the data/Message/file. You can send this with anyone.

AND 

Private Key to decrypt the data/Message/file.


Example Use Cases:

Sending Secure Messages: If you want to send a message securely to someone, 
you encrypt the message with their public key, and only they (with their private key) can decrypt it.

Digital Signatures: Asymmetric encryption is also used for digital signatures 
where the sender uses their private key to sign a message, and anyone can verify the signature 
using the sender's public key.
