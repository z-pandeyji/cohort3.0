Topics Covered
1. I/O Task - heavy operations refer to tasks in a computer program that involve a lot of data 
transfer between the program and external systems or devices.

2. Callbacks - A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is
called when the outer function has finished its execution.

3. functional arguments - Create a function that accepts a function as an argument.

4. Async vs Sync Code - Asynchronous code is code that runs outside of the main thread of execution.
Synchronous code is code that runs inside the main thread of execution.

5. Event Loops - The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, and there are 
callbacks in the callback queue, it will push the first callback from the queue onto the call stack for 
execution.

6. Callback queues - when a callback is added to a queue, the event loop will check the queue and 
execute the callbacks that are ready to be executed.
